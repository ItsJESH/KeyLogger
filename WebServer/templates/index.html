    <div class="output">
    [-] Imagine you’re typing on your keyboard — your super secret passwords 😳, your Netflix login 😨, your weird search history (I'm not judging) ☠️... <span class="bd">Now imagine someone is watching every single key you press. 😱</span><br>
    That creepy Nah? 💀 It’s called a <span class="kl">keylogger.</span> </br>
    <br>
    [-] It’s like a sneaky little spy living in your computer, writing down everything you type — from “hello” to “my bank password is 1234” (please don’t use that). 🕵️‍♂️
    It can run in the background using scripts or executables, often hidden from the user.

    <div class="command">$ How Do They Get In?</div>
    <div class="output">
    Me send you tricky emails like:<br>
    <a  class="iphone"  onclick="openPopup('iphone')">
    “You’ve won a free iPhone📱, click here to get!” 📦🎁<br></a>
    [-] You click (because who wouldn’t want a free iPhone?), and BOOM — the keylogger sneaks in like a ninja. 🥷 <br>
    [-] It hides in your system and starts snatching your info: passwords, credit card numbers, Instagram logins, even that crush DM you were nervously typing.

              With over 1,025 horsepower and a 0–60 mph time of 1.66 seconds, this beast is ready for your garage.
            </p>

    He's Brain 🧠:
    <code>Bro... I didn't even enter a contest, but the universe knows I deserve 1,025 HP. </code><br>
    He clicks the “Claim My Demon 170” button like it owes him gas money.<br>
    <br>
    He’s redirected to a slick-looking Dodge page — it’s got the logo, the muscle car background, even engine revving sounds.<br>
    It says: <code>Please enter your driver's license info and verify with your email to claim your reward.</code></br>
    Elon, fully revved up, drops<br>

- His full name <br>
- His email & password<br>
- And... his actual driver's license number 🪪 <br>

🎯 Hacker's like: "VROOOOM. Identity theft secured."<br><br>

After submitting the form, Elon is told: <code>Final step: Download and open the Challenger 3D View Tool to start the engine remotely.</code>
Naturally, the file is called: <code>StartYourDemon.exe</code><br>
Elon downloads and runs it with the confidence of a man who's definitely about to hit 0–60 in 1.66 seconds. <br>
🎯 But instead of horsepower, he gets... <span class="kl">keylogger</span> power.<br>
It installs silently, no vroom vroom 🚗, no tire smoke  — just invisible doom.<br><br>
Elon continues his day<br>
- Logs into his crypto wallet to brag about "real assets" 💎<br>
- Checks his email to see if Dodge replied (spoiler: they didn’t) 📩<br>
- Orders some expensive car accessories, just in case 🛒<br>
The keylogger captures:<br>
- Every keystroke<br>
- Every password<br>
- Even that angry text he deleted where he typed “IS THIS A SCAM?”<br>
Meanwhile, the hacker’s dashboard lights up like a Christmas tree. 🎄<br><br>

By the next morning<br>
- Elon’s crypto is gone<br>
- His email is locked<br>
- His bank calls him about a weird car loan opened in his name... for a Toyota Prius in Kazakhstan<br>

Worst part?<br>
He’s still walking. 🥲<br><br>

Elon starts piecing it together:<br>
- No car<br>
- No cash<br>
- Just... shame and pop-up ads for engine oil<br>

He googles:<br>
- “Can a car giveaway steal your identity?”<br>
- “How to remove keylogger without throwing laptop”<br>
- “Can you un-click something”<br>


<span style="font-size:110%; color: Yellow">Moral of the Story 😇<br> </span>
    <span style="font-size:105%;color: Yellow">If a random email says you won a 1,025 horsepower supercar, it’s probably not real.<br>
But the malware? Oh, that’s very real.<span>

    Oh, just EVERYTHING:<br>

        - Your secret pizza order at 2AM 🍕<br>
        - Stuff you didn’t even finish typing! 🌚<br>
    Yes, it can even log keys when the letters don’t show up on the screen. Spooky, right?

    <div class="output">
    Think you might have a keylogger? Here’s how to play digital detective<br>
    - 🐢 Your computer feels slow – like it just woke up from a nap and hasn't had coffee yet.<br>
    - 🧛‍♂️ Something’s running in the background, but you didn’t open it. Suspicious!<br>
    - 💾 Weird files or programs you don’t remember installing are just... there.<br>
    - 🌐 Internet acting strange – like sending secret messages behind your back.<br>
    - 🧠 You forgot your password, but someone else didn’t. Uh-oh... ☠️<br>
    In short: if your laptop feels haunted — it might be... 👻

    <div class="command">$ How to Stop Keyloggers (Like a Cyber Ninja)</div>
    <div class="output">
    Don’t panic! Here’s how to keep your computer safe and sound, <br>
    - 🚫 Don’t click sketchy links, especially ones that scream “WIN A PS5” or “SEE WHO VISITED YOUR PROFILE” 🚗💀 <br>
    - 🧼 Keep your software updated – updates = digital soap. Clean those bugs out! <br>
    - 🦠 Install a good antivirus – let the software do the ninja work. <br>
    - 🔐 Use 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication) – even if your password gets stolen, the hacker still needs your phone.   <br>
    - 🧹 Check your Task Manager every now and then. If you see a process named “notavirus.exe”... yeah, it’s probably a it. <br>
    - 🧊 Use a password manager – so you don’t type passwords in the first place! <br>
